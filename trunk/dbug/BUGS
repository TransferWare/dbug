Bugs

* Windows OS libraries

On a Windows platform the DBUG library can be built using the standard
Microsoft OS libraries (i.e. without the Cygwin DLL). There are two
approaches:
1) For Cygwin 1.5.x and below use the cygwin GCC compiler with MinGW support
and add the -mno-cygwin option to the compiler command.

  $ configure CC="gcc -mno-cygwin"

2) For Cygwin 1.7.x and above the -mno-cygwin option has been removed.
   a) for Cygwin 32 bit install the Cygwin packages mingw-gcc-core and mingw-runtime
   b) for Cygwin 64 bit install the Cygwin packages mingw64-i686-gcc-core and mingw64-i686-runtime

   Next use the following flags during configuration:

  $ configure --prefix=/cygdrive/c/usr/local CC="gcc -mwindows"

* multiple targets patterns

On the Cygwin platform the following commands

  $ configure --prefix=c:/usr/local
  $ make

may eventually result in the make error message concerning multiple
targets patterns. This is because of the colon in the prefix and
targets which depend on a file below the directory specified with the
prefix. The generated Makefile contains (hidden by variables) something like:

TARGET: ... c:/usr/local/DEPENDENCY

So there are two colons in the make rule, which is plain wrong.

Solution: change the prefix into /cygdrive/c/usr/local.

* configure: error: C++ preprocessor "/lib/cpp" fails sanity check

This has happened on the Mac.

$ which cpp
/usr/bin/cpp

Run 

$ configure CXXCPP="/usr/bin/cpp"

* make check fails in an MSYS environment when pthreadGC2.dll could not be found
