Bugs

* On a Windows platform the DBUG library can be built with Cygwin using the
  standard OS libraries (i.e. without the Cygwin DLL). There are two approaches:
  1) Use the MinGW compiler by putting the MinGW bin directory in the PATH
  before the GNU C compiler directory. The disadvantage is that 
  $ make all 
  and
  $ make check
  fail.
  2) Use the GNU C compiler with the -mno-cygwin option. However a shared DBUG
  library (DLL) results in rebase errors for other programs linked with the
  DLL.

  The best solution is to build the DBUG library static with the standard GNU
  compiler and the -mno-cygwin option.
