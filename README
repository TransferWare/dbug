This is `DBUG', a Posix-threads debugging library.

DBUG itself consists of the library (-ldbug), reporting tool dbugrpt and
the header dbug.h installed in /usr/local/lib, /usr/local/bin and
/usr/local/include by default. For Cygwin environments they are
installed into /cygdrive/c/usr/local/lib, etcetera. The compiler (CC
variable) will be set to to "gcc -mno-cygwin" (if not set already).


See INSTALL for installation instructions.
